# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:

To complete the Combined Scenarois.

## Algorithm:

Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.


## Output:

LAB EXPERIMENT 6

1. Solution Ideation – Crazy 8s Brainstorming Exercise
Problem: Users struggle to easily and quickly book appointments in a hospital app due to cluttered navigation and confusing options.
Crazy 8s - 8 Quick Low-Fidelity Ideas:
1.	Single Tap Booking: A dashboard with a “Book Now” button that uses the last appointment’s doctor and location by default.
2.	Specialty-Based Search: Filter doctors by specialty with icons (e.g., heart for cardiologist) for quick visual navigation.
3.	Chatbot Booking: A conversational interface that asks, “What’s the issue today?” and guides users to book.
4.	Voice Assistant Integration: Users can say, “Book a dentist for Friday morning,” and the app books accordingly.
5.	Calendar View: Users see available slots in a calendar-style view, selecting date and time directly.
6.	Symptom Checker to Booking: A symptom checker that recommends a relevant specialist and books an appointment.
7.	Recent Visits Shortcut: A tile-based dashboard showing recent doctors or clinics with a “Rebook” option.
8.	Emergency Quick Access: A red button for emergency or same-day bookings, prioritizing urgent care.

2. Creating User Stories
Persona:
•	Name: Priya, 29
•	Profession: Marketing Manager
•	Pain Point: Finds medical apps overwhelming due to busy UI. Needs quick booking due to her tight schedule.
User Stories:
1.	As a busy professional, I want to book an appointment in 2–3 steps, so that I don’t waste time navigating complex menus.
2.	As a returning patient, I want to quickly rebook a previous doctor, so that I can continue treatment without delay.
3.	As a first-time user, I want to search doctors by symptom, so that I find the right specialist without medical knowledge.
4.	As a tech-savvy user, I want to use voice commands to book appointments, so that I can multitask effectively.
5.	As a parent, I want to book pediatric appointments for my child, so that I manage family healthcare efficiently.

3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:
As a busy professional, I want to book an appointment in 2–3 steps, so that I don’t waste time navigating complex menus.
Scenario:
Priya is in the middle of a hectic workday and remembers she needs to book a follow-up with her dermatologist. She's stressed and has a limited 10-minute break before her next meeting. She opens the hospital app while sitting at her desk, hoping to book quickly. She's relieved to see a “Rebook Last Visit” option on the home screen. With just two taps and a confirmation, her appointment is set for Friday at 6 PM. She feels a sense of accomplishment and less anxious knowing her healthcare is managed.
